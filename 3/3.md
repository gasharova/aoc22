When I saw splitting the strings in half, I immediately knew I'll do string slicing. Thank Python for that.

I went through the input line by line, cut each line in half, and wrote two small functions to let me know which char is the mutual one and whats the total priority sum.

```
with open('input3_1.txt') as inputfile:
    for line in inputfile:
        compartment_size = int(len(line)/2)

        first_compartment = line[0:compartment_size]
        second_compartment = line[compartment_size:len(line)-1]

        shared_item = get_shared_types_list(first_compartment, second_compartment)

        all_shared_items += shared_item
```

```
def get_shared_types_list(first, second):
    for c in first:
        if c in second:
            return c
            
def get_priority_for_items(items):
    temp_sum = 0
    for item in items:
        if item.islower():
            temp_sum += ord(item)-96
        else:
            temp_sum += ord(item)-38
    return temp_sum
```

Unfortunately, I didn't understand the task well. I thought that final list of common characters must be unique (since we are talking about *types* of items). So I lost cca 20 extra minutes on that and eventually, once I removed that line and tried the answer on the website, I realized that I shouldn't have made it unique at all.

For part 2, I modified the fn that gets the shared type to instead take 3 strings as input instead of 2. Also, I made a counter and a limitation so that every 3 lines we can run the get_shared_type function and extract the item type, and afterwards perform a clean up before continuing with the next 3.

```
def get_shared_type(first, second, third):
    for c in first:
        if c in second:
            if c in third:
                return c
```

```
with open('input3_2.txt') as inputfile:
    for line in inputfile:
        if line_counter == 4:
            group_item_type = get_shared_type(lines[0], lines[1], lines[2])
            line_counter = 1
            lines.clear()
            all_shared_items += group_item_type

        lines.append(line)
        line_counter += 1
```

I forgot to take into account that with the day I modelled my main function, the execution of each group is done at the beginning of the 4th line (1st line of next group), so I was missing the very last addition (group number 100's shared item) for a while. 

In this case the website didn't say that the number was too high or too low, which helped me suspect that I'm missing just one element somewhere.

To make it easier for me, I just added one new line at the end of the input to get the sum to work.

In total I spent around an hour on the task, most of which reading :)
