Part 1

We will iterate through each character and keep an eye on the last 4 chars. 

One important thing to mention that is a catch is to think what to do if there is a repeating character before we reach the 4 diff chars marker.

For this reason, I will define my checks like this: If I do it to check if the current character is in the buffer set, then if it's true, I'll have to do something immediately after. This is going to cause issues as I dont know the position of the value that repeats and it will complicate things.

Instead, I will pop the first element of the buffer and add the current symbol to the end of it. And only then, I'll check if there is any repeating characters in the buffer. This way it will keep iterating and only stop when there aren't any repeats.

And its done! Immediately got the answer.

For Part 2, I literally just changed the numbers 4, which happen to be in the code twice, to 14, and under a minute I got the Part 2 answer. Isn't that crazy?! This was my fastest programming problem solution submission ever...

In all honesty, the tasks for today were much easier than yesterday's! I took a total of ~15min, including writing this MD file.
